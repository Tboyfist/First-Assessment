Topic Classification
A component of natural language processing is Topic modeling, which can be used in mining a bulk sum of text or data where a collection of documents is taken by a topic model as an input, and without supervision attempts to uncover the underlying topics in this collection. (Jordan, 2003)

During this task, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic model were used to get the topics from the dataset. The data was on a manually collected unstructured dataset and was scrapped from Scopus using the keywords Weather.
The dataset will be examined and cleaned before used to train the model which will generate reasonable topics from the scraped dataset.
Weather is said to be the atmospheric condition at a particular place with time. It is measured in terms of variables including wind speed and direction, air temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, cloudiness, and precipitation. Weather can change at any time.
This task utilizes topic modeling techniques LDA and BERTopic for the analysis of extensive unstructured text data. The aim of this task is to detect key topics from the chosen dataset, thereby significantly reducing the time required for manual reading of dataset.
